I spent most of 2020 looking at opportunities to help the general public navigate the public health crisis. [Lumedic](https://www.lumedic.io/), a Providence portfolio company, had an existing broad use medical-record-on-blockchain technology that we pivoted to serve as a single use digital passport. Our product planning & research followed as the science & politics evolved throughout the year, first as a time oriented test result passport and eventually also containing vaccine status card.

The app was originally based on an existing structure from [Connect.me](https://connect.me/) that we audited from a user experience pov with the goal of creating a Holder & Verifier handshake scenario. My work centered around architecting the multimodal experience of permissions, mobile devices scanning QR codes on desktop web apps, and on each other’s devices, working with user expectations and building prototypes with my UX Research partner [Jeanine Ledoux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanineledoux/). In addition to serving as the daily scrum designer for the web app and both iOS & Android releases.

Wireframing was done in Miro and Figma. The visual branding work was built on top of [IBM’s Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) design system. Illustrations by [Smashing Ideas](https://smashingideas.com/).
