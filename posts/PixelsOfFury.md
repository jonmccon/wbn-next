Shutterstock wanted the Seattle AIGA chapter to host one of its battles in the [Pixels of Fury](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/design/design-inspiration/pixels-of-fury) championship and I was able to play ringmaster at the lovely Makers Space for a night.

Fueled by pizza, cupcakes and [Hilliards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilliard%27s_Beer), six local designers duked it out in front of creative directors from [Tether](http://www.tetherinc.com/) and [Digital Kitchen](http://thisisdk.com/) in three rounds of 20 minute poster battles announced by [Terry Marks](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/terry-marks/1/1b5/91b). I built my own 3D cardboard & hot glue adaptation of the newly announced Adobe CC logo to have it disassembled in a festive mere seconds after announcing the final winner. Luckily we had a proper crystal trophy, just in case.
