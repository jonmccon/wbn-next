Metastream sought to engage with the cohabitants of Seattle through an augmented reflection our environmental timeline. A map to see and understand surrounding realtime data and accessible only by being near a physical locale. 

In collaboration with cofounder [Mike Shrieve](https://twitter.com/untelcombat), a study that leveraged (and required us to learn) progressive web apps, Mapbox, Firebase, Google Cloud platform, and Gitlab. In collaboration with the [Open Streetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) community and public data from the [City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/).
