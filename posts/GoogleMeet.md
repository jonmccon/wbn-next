The [Hangouts Meet](https://design.google/) team was interested in prototyping connection alternatives to better serve customers with infrastructure limitations and explore hardware enhanced performance. My role was two-fold, one in helping to prototype a downloadable Windows & Mac adaptation of the existing webapp. For which I collaborated with the [Material](https://material.io/design) team to discuss appropriate translations of interaction language outside of the browser. Including early visual explorations of [dark mode](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html).

Secondly, in designing a more robust web-to-phone connection that lives online. So that you & your voice show up as the same participant.
