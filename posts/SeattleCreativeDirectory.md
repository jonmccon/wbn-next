Seattle's creative community has a strong identity but its data is disparate, resources exist but aren't comprehensive or easy to find. So I’m cataloging the design studios, inhouse product groups, architecture firms, printers, photographers, letterers so we can support each other and act as resource.

In tandem with the website, I’m recording audio interviews with the owners of these companies in an effort to understand them, but also to understand what it means to be a creative professional.
