As a programming co-director for the Seattle chapter of AIGA I was responsible for event production and general chapter engagement with the public. However, after a handful of years of being involved in varying on-the-ground capacities before taking a proper board position, I was able to see where we had stumbled operationally. So in the process of streamlining my planning, promoting and running events I built out structure on varying web platforms and adapted them into chapter wide processes.
-
Helping to build out our portfolio of tools, the chapter handled ticketing online at Eventbrite and in-person checkin (or at the door sales). Square readers are still on hand for any merch or drinks (with distributed gray accounts for volunteers' personal phones). 
-
Below is a site theme built on a Wordpress backend that the national organization had proved chapters to leverage. Ina addition to Google Forms for internal requests automatically routed to the correct board member, and a server structure for shared resources on our Google Apps account (in collaboration with my co-director Calvin Carter).
-
Design collaboration with Ben Hubbard for the theme. The geometric graphic work was a part of a membership rebrand from Kiss Me Iâ€™m Polish done at the same time.

The custom theme was built but not used, in favor of the default theme provided
