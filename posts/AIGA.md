As a programming co-director for the Seattle chapter of AIGA I was responsible for event production and general chapter engagement with the public. However, after a handful of years of being involved in varying on-the-ground capacities before taking a proper board position, I was able to see where we had stumbled operationally. So in the process of streamlining my planning, promoting and running events I built out structure on varying web platforms and adapted them into chapter wide processes.
-
Helping to build out our portfolio of tools, the chapter handled ticketing online at Eventbrite and in-person checkin (or at the door sales). Square readers are still on hand for any merch or drinks (with distributed gray accounts for volunteers' personal phones). 
-
Below is a site theme built on a Wordpress backend that the national organization had proved chapters to leverage. Ina addition to Google Forms for internal requests automatically routed to the correct board member, and a server structure for shared resources on our Google Apps account (in collaboration with my co-director Calvin Carter).
-
Design collaboration with Ben Hubbard for the theme. The geometric graphic work was a part of a membership rebrand from Kiss Me Iâ€™m Polish done at the same time. 
-
The custom theme was built but not used, in favor of the default theme provided

Seattle Design Studio Tours
To keep the neighborhood tradition alive, I helped produce the [Capitol Hill](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aiga_seattle/sets/72157641575143395/) & [Pioneer Square](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aiga_seattle/sets/72157644638789788/) studio tours. Collaborations with [Neil Palmer](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/neil-palmer/48/215/245) to build promotional and mobile mapping tools made it feel like a proper gallery walk.

Pixels of Fury
Live Design Battles
Shutterstock wanted the Seattle AIGA chapter to host one of its battles in the [Pixels of Fury](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/design/design-inspiration/pixels-of-fury) championship and I was able to play ringmaster at the lovely Makers Space for a night. 
-
Fueled by pizza, [cupcakes](https://www.cupcakeroyale.com/) and [Hilliards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilliard%27s_Beer), six local designers duked it out in front of creative directors from [Tether](http://www.tetherinc.com/) and [Digital Kitchen](http://thisisdk.com/) in three rounds of 20 minute poster battles announced by [Terry Marks](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/terry-marks/1/1b5/91b). I built my own 3D cardboard & hot glue adaptation of the newly announced Adobe CC logo to have it disassembled in a festive mere seconds after announcing the final winner. Luckily we had a proper crystal trophy, just in case.
