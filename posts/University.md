In the North, near an arboretum strewn with brick, was a small tower dedicated to learning the craft of applied design thinking. Problem was, no one ventured up there much.

I was able to pull together an extra graduating show, planned with a handful of students, in Seattle's Pioneer Square at the [Tether](http://www.tetherinc.com/) Gallery. Single projects from 16 seniors, packed house, ridiculous guest book, what's better?

The screen printing atelier, if you will, was sort of an attic of toys for a design student. Multiple shows of loosely themed & beautifully printed shenanigans were pulled for venues in Bellingham. It was only when we took over a former antique storefront, [on a corner of Georgetown](https://goo.gl/maps/DgKevncVfmhS6ycH6), were we able to create our own gallery for the work we created.
