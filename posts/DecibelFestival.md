I produced the first & second annual official [Decibel Festival](http://dbfestival.com/) Popup Artshows featuring over 40 local poster designers. Maybe it's just a part of a proper show opening to the public, but unfortunately you really had to be there for these.

The 2013 centennial show called upon the talents of [Ben Van Citters](http://benvancitters.com/), [Nick Bartoletti](http://vimeo.com/bartoletti), [Chris Blohm](https://www.instagram.com/chris.blohm/) and Patrick Wright to projection map and augment the whole show (from window displays, to rotating poster frames, to dancing skeleton tracking via Kinnect). A monday night quadruple kegger later, it was the highest attended opening event in the festival's history.

2014 marked the introduction of [EMP's](https://www.mopop.org/) (MoPOP) partnership with Decibel and made the poster festival a part of the Opening Gala in the Skychurch.

Email is often overlooked, but when approached at a person-to-person scale, it can be a powerful and honest driving force to inspire being a part of a poster show full of your friends. All it takes is a Google Form, a spreadsheet, Mailchimp's merge tags, a heavy dose of heartfelt honesty and you're just a pushpin supply away from an artshow.
