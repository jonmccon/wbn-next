To keep the neighborhood tradition alive, I helped produce the [Capitol Hill](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aiga_seattle/sets/72157641575143395/) & [Pioneer Square](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aiga_seattle/sets/72157644638789788/) studio tours. Collaborations with [Neil Palmer](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/neil-palmer/48/215/245) to build promotional and mobile mapping tools made it feel like a proper gallery walk.
