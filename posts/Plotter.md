Originally I built a [single head printer](https://www.makeblock.com/project/xy-plotter-robot-kit) to draw vectors and while flat things are fun to draw, I decided to extract vectors from photogrammetry models and print them flat with a ballpoint pen. 
-
Eventually I didnâ€™t feel I had enough control over the fidelity of the drawings. So I stripped all the electronics and rebuilt the plotter with an Arduino Uno + [gShield](https://synthetos.myshopify.com/products/gshield-v5), a gentler printhead, and more power.  
-
My early scans were with a digital camera, which was great for large objects. Many forums later, I was able to build a rotating turntable and python server that ran on my phone to take photos and step to the next position, which allows for consistent detail on smaller objects.
